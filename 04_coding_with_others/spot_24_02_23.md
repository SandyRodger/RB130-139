Closures:
 - chunk of code to pass around and execute later. 
Why is a closure not a method?
 - BINDING: Method: self contained scope. Closure: creates it own scope for surrounding environment. 
 - CAN DEFER EXECUTION: ... but can't methods do that too?

```ruby
a_proc = proc {'hello'}
  

def some_method(&block)
  block.call if block_given?    #Â does #block_given? only scan for implicit blocks or explicit blocks too?
end

p some_method(&a_proc)
```

* Brenno's article about Venner interviewing Matz about Closures. Why some people don't consider blocks to be closures.

Quesions:

1.  Where exactly is the block created and its binding saved in this example:

<img width="928" alt="Screenshot 2023-03-14 at 17 11 11" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78854926/225084398-73ad2689-2e79-4834-a0d3-c5fb2fb5a250.png">

I think it must be when it's defined as an implicit argument ot the method. I mean it must be. It's just a little confusing how it exists sort of on the edge of the method, entering it, but looking back over its shoulder.

2. What are Lambdas exactly?
